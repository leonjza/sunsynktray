# gpui-tray

Native system tray integration built specifically for GPUI. Tray menu entries
are ordinary `gpui::MenuItem`s and clicks dispatch ordinary GPUI actions.

The crate has three native backends:

- macOS: AppKit through `objc2`
- Windows: `Shell_NotifyIconW` plus a hidden top-level window and Win32 menus
- Linux: StatusNotifierItem and DBusMenu through `zbus` (no GTK)

It does not start a second application event loop. Native callbacks send small,
platform-neutral events to a task on GPUI's foreground executor.

## Run the example

From a graphical desktop session, run:

```sh
cargo run --example tray --features menu-state
```

The example has no application window. Use its tray menu to change checked and
disabled state, increment the counter, and quit. Its icon is generated in code,
so no external assets are required.

```rust,ignore
use gpui::{App, Menu, MenuItem, actions};
use gpui_tray::{Icon, Tray};

actions!(tray_example, [Open, ToggleMode, Quit]);

fn build_tray(cx: &mut App, icon: Icon) -> gpui_tray::Result<Tray> {
    Tray::builder()
        .icon(icon)
        .title("My App")
        .tooltip("My App")
        .menu(|_cx| {
            vec![
                MenuItem::action("Open", Open),
                MenuItem::submenu(
                    Menu::new("View")
                        .items([MenuItem::action("Toggle mode", ToggleMode)]),
                ),
                MenuItem::separator(),
                MenuItem::action("Quit", Quit),
            ]
        })
        .build(cx)
}
```

Call `Tray::refresh_menu` after state changes outside tray actions. The menu is
automatically rebuilt after a tray action is dispatched. With `menu-state`
enabled, checked/disabled state produced by synchronous action handlers updates
immediately.

`Tray::close` removes the native item deterministically and is safe to call more
than once. Dropping the last clone performs the same cleanup on a best-effort
basis.

## Checked and disabled menu state

GPUI's checked/disabled menu API currently exists on GPUI main but is not in a
separately versioned crates.io release. Enable the `menu-state` feature when
using a GPUI revision that provides `MenuItem::is_checked` and
`MenuItem::is_disabled`:

```toml
gpui-tray = { version = "0.1", features = ["menu-state"] }
```

The feature is disabled by default for compatibility with GPUI 0.2.2. Without
it, tray menu entries are treated as enabled and unchecked. Once GPUI 0.2.3 is
released, the existing `^0.2.2` dependency requirement can resolve to it and
the feature will work without a git dependency.
